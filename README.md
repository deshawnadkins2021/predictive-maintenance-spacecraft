# ðŸš€ Predictive Maintenance for Spacecraft Systems  

This project applies **machine learning** to predict potential spacecraft subsystem failures using sensor data. The goal is to enable proactive maintenance, reduce mission risks, and extend spacecraft operational lifetimes.

## âœ¨ Features
- Uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict failures.  
- Dataset includes critical sensor readings:  
  - Temperature  
  - Pressure  
  - Vibration  
  - Radiation  
  - Power Output  
- Generates performance reports:  
  - **Confusion Matrix**  
  - **Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)**  
- Easy to extend with other ML models (SVM, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks).
