# Predictive Maintenance for Spacecraft Systems  
This project uses machine learning to predict spacecraft failures based on sensor data.  

## Features  
- Uses Random Forest Classifier for failure prediction  
- Dataset includes temperature, pressure, vibration, radiation, and power output readings  
- Generates confusion matrix and accuracy report  

## Files  
- **spacecraft_sensor_data.csv** → Dataset  
- **model_evaluation.txt** → Model performance report
